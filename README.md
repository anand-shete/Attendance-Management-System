This was first major project I made in second year at SIES GST, Nerul.                                                                                                                                                      
This Project uses QR Code scanner with the 'html5-qrcode' npm package.
JWT Authentication that stores data of students and teachers in a cookie.
It also uses 'crypto' npm package to generated hashed passwords that are saved to MongoDB cluster.                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                      

// To use my project

Step-1 : Clone the git-repository                                                                                                                                     
Step-2 : Inside project root directory, run command 'npm install' to install all the dependencies                                                                     
Step-3 : Ensure that MongoDB is intalled in your system and run command 'node ./index.js'                                                                             

If it says,
