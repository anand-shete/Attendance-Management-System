// To use my project

Step-1 : Clone the git-repository                                                                                                                                     
Step-2 : Inside project root directory, run command 'npm install' to install all the dependencies                                                                     
Step-3 : Ensure that MongoDB is intalled in your system and run command 'node ./index.js'
