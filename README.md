# Attendance Management System
A full-stack web application built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It enables teachers to generate QR codes for attendance marking, while students can scan these codes to record their presence. The system ensures secure authentication, real-time attendance tracking, and role-based access control.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/anand-shete/Attendance-Management-System.git
cd Attendance-Management-System
```

2. Install dependencies for backend and frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables
Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories and add the following variables:

   #### Backend `.env`
- `MONGO_URL`: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JSON Web Token authentication
- `PORT`: Port for the backend server (e.g., 5000)
- `MODE`: For development, use `development`
- `FRONTEND_URL`: For development, use `http://localhost:5173`

   #### Frontend `.env`
- `VITE_RENDER_API`: Base URL of the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api`)

4. Start the Backend server
```
npm run start
```

5. Start the Frontend
```
npm run dev
```




## Troubleshooting
- **MongoDB Connection Error**: Ensure your `MONGO_URL` is correct and that your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas.  
- **CORS Issues**: Verify that the `FRONTEND_URL` matches the backend URL and port.  
- **QR Code Not Scanning**: Ensure the `html5-qrcode` library is properly installed and camera permissions are granted in the browser.
